# Codewars Practice

Solutions to coding challenges (kata) from [Codewrs](https://www.codewars.com/), solved in Python using Jupyter notebooks.

## About this repository

This collection includes a variety of kata across algorithms, mathematics, and data manipulation. Each solution is presented in a standalone notebook with a clear problem description, approach, and implementation.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook).
3. Open any `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to view the problem, solution, and run the code.

You can also view the notebooks directly in GitHub or on [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.org/) by pasting the file URL.

## Topics covered

- String processing and regular expressions
- Numerical algorithms and mathematics
- Data structures and algorithm design
- Simple SQL queries (for more advanced analytics, see my [SQL-queries](https://github.com/utsapoddar/SQL-queries) repository)

## Contribution / Next steps

I'm continuously adding new solutions as I practice more katas. Feel free to fork this repository, open issues, or submit pull requests for improvements.
